### Hello,

I am a Brazilian General Surgeon, currently pursuing a Masters of Public Health from Columbia University Mailman SPH's Biostatistics Department. 

I am also a General Surgery Residency applicant in this Match cycle, looking towards a career as an academic surgeon in the U.S.

My clinical interest lies in the intersection between surgical oncology and hepatobiliary pancreatic surgery.

My research interests are clinical outcomes and de-implementation science, as well as surgical education.

I live with my dear wife, Rafaela, and our dog, Zelda. We enjoy spending time in parks, traveling, bindgewatching Netflix, and playing boardgames.

In [this page](resume.html) you can find my academic and professional experiences.
