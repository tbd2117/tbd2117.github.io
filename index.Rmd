### Hello,

I am a Brazilian General Surgeon and incoming Prelim General Surgery Resident at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

I have just completed my Masters of Public Health from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health's Biostatistics Department with a certificate in Advanced Epidemiology. 

My clinical interests are surgical oncology, hepatobiliary & pancreatic surgery, and endocrine surgery.

My research interests are clinical outcomes and surgical education.

I live with my dear wife, Rafaela, and our dog, Zelda. We enjoy spending time in parks, traveling, eating carbs, drinking wine, watching Netflix, and playing boardgames.
